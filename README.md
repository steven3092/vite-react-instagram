# App deployed with Netlify

- https://main--instagroom-prod.netlify.app/

# React + TypeScript + Vite (Instagroom)

This small app is an instagram-like app.
I got inspiration of the real instagram and tried to reproduce as it, on the desktop version.

I use faker to simulate data.

The idea was to focus on the front side only, and mainly sass design.

There is a little bit of functionalities like adding a comment, or like a photo.

There is no navigation settled. Is just the home page from instagram.

Below a small video for more context :
